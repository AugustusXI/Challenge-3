# Challenge-3
 Javascript challenge 3

 The challenge was to create a password generator that creates the password based on a number of criteria

 I created a series of variables to contain the criteria for the password construction.

 I added HTML to have my function be called on onclick of the generate button

 Wrote a function designed to ask a series of questions to the user and then log that information inside of variables
